# ScalingApp
WIP on an app that will allow to rescale different values freely.
Example: 1cm in 1:50 scale would be 50cm in 1:1 and 2cm in 1:25.
This app will help with that by making a dynamic output based on input given by an user.
It needs a starting number/value you want to convert, the scale used and the scale needed.


For now only works in BlueJ IDE.
